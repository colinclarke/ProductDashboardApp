The backend is a RESTful API built on the Maven architecture using the Spring Boot framework. A MySQL database is used in conjunction with Spring JPA to persist data. Spring Boot Security was used for CORS as well as role based access control. JUnit 5 was used for testing. AspectJ and Log4j were used for logging. Swagger was used for API documentation.

The Frontend is a React JS app with functional components that use a variety of react hooks. Axios was sometimes used to access the backend, but we also wrote our own fetch statements. We used Bootstrap and React Bootstrap for the styling the UI.
