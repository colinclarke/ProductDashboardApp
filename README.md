# Product Dashboard App
Allows users and admins to perform CRUD operations on a list of products. Users are not allowed to create new products, nor are they able to edit the price of an item.
Otherwise, users are able to update, delete and view the products as they please. Admins, of course, have full access.

# Technologies
Built on the Maven architecture, this application mainly relies on the Spring MVC framework. 
JSP and bootstrap were used on the frontend, while the backend used JPA and a MySQL database.
